<br />
<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
    Banana Forest started as an IT student small game: functionnal, moderatly fun, but with graphics that makes you regrets having eyes! <br />
    Upon release on itch.io, it encountered a moderate success, with a few hundreds plays on itch.io and a few hundreds plays on itch.io
    <br /><br />
    Things could have remained like that, and this project would have been lost and forgotten in the abyss of the internet... <br />
    If I didn't, a few years later, meet an awesome artist with whom I now share my life. <br />
    As kids are way overated, we decided to pursue this project create our first complete and published game together : Banana Forest 2!

<MudText Typo="Typo.body2" GutterBottom="true">
    If you're exploring the features of .NET 9 Blazor,<br /> you might be pleasantly surprised to learn that each page is prerendered on the server,<br /> regardless of the selected render mode.<br /><br />
    This means that you'll need to inject all necessary services on the server,<br /> even when opting for the wasm (WebAssembly) render mode.<br /><br />
    This prerendering functionality is crucial to ensuring that WebAssembly mode feels fast and responsive,<br /> especially when it comes to initial page load times.<br /><br />
    For more information on how to detect prerendering and leverage the RenderContext, you can refer to the following link:
