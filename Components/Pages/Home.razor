<MudText Typo="Typo.h5" GutterBottom="true">How it started: Banana Forest 1</MudText>
<br />
<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
    Banana Forest started as an IT student small game: functionnal, moderatly fun, but with graphics that makes you regrets having eyes! <br />
    Upon release on itch.io, it encountered a moderate success, with a few hundreds plays on itch.io and a few hundreds plays on itch.io
    <br /><br />
    Things could have remained like that, and this project would have been lost and forgotten in the abyss of the internet... <br />
    If I didn't, a few years later, meet an awesome artist with whom I now share my life. <br />
    As kids are way overated, we decided to pursue this project create our first complete and published game together : Banana Forest 2!
